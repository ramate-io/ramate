## Summary
Ramate intends to stand for its namesake--as an organization with branches; one with structure, pragmatism, and divergence that operates; that is curious, steady, and small. Slowly, I ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)) endeavor to build the organization up as a guild for those fingerling pursuits which reach out towards the sun--which fan out boldly across the solution space and draw back to a humanistic trunk.

This begins in computing, particularly decentralized computing, whereunder Ramate's stewardship of [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac) is intended to breath life into the organization--in capital and spirit. However, even in this breath, I foresee the apical budding of many pursuits which draw to the same stem.

## Proclamation
Ramate means "having branches" and it is the principle analogized in this natural phenomenon for which this organization stands.

Just as a broad-leaf tree--in capturing the energy of the sun--may split and stretch itself into a corona, so too does this organization intend to fan out. This is not to condone wasteful or distracted growth; each branch must support its weight with its structure. Rather, it is to mark vibrance which the world enjoys and which shall be reflected in this organization.

As such, when we find ourselves upon a pursuit that is too driving--which draws too much from a fixed point we do not understand--we should question whether we are pushing a stem into closing shade, sending a taproot into acrid soil--following before we grow.

For all this waxing, there is a pragmatism in this understanding of self. Even in the ostensible hyperspecialization of the modern era, it is hard to drive a pile through the markets to a particular wellspring.

Amongst the popular giants, Yamaha builds pianos, generators, and motorbikes; Amazon e-commerce, cloud computing, and grocery stores; 3M adhesives, medical supplies, and building materials.

While one can and should criticize how these organizations may chase the bottom line, build monopolies, and generally treat people, I would argue their success still comes on the back of a certain liveliness and branching to operations which is worth admiration.

Ostensibly, this is a belief often parroted on a lower-level in the offices of technology companies--wherein "agile" practices reign as an ideal despite their detractors. I would suggest, however, that agile is corrupted by performance and scale.

I have seen--in my albeit short experience--that a proclamation of growing nimbly is often deformed into a distracted attempt to impress.

I have seen too often scale--even slight--bury the plot and dialogue of enterprise.

There is an art to this. An organization, particularly one formed as a business, is a non-trivial structure. Its bounds are unclear and it is difficult to glue all of the local realities into a cohesive model.

The art which Ramate shall endeavor shifts the notion of agility to one of branching. Branching concerns itself not with movement for the sake of the organization's benefit, but asks what pursuits we may support and later be supported by. Branching does not emphasize speed, but its steadiness surprises as splits become exponential. Branching does not leap to scale, there is only so much the tree can support before its essence is best left to a new seed.

This is to say, I endeavor to keep Ramate curious.

When a computing colleague approaches with an exotic computing premise, our instinct shall be to wonder how it may relate to [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac).

When a starving friend seeks to grow her sculpture business, our instinct shall be to consider how it may become "artisanal merch."

When an uncle moans about trying to find new business for his clothing line, our instinct shall be to consider whether we can facilitate a pop-up or brand partnership.

This is to say, I endeavor to keep Ramate steady.

When a new application presents, we shall not launch into it on a whim but consider it broadly over months.

When we miss a deadline, we shall not have placed ourselves in a position to panic as a hasty delivery would have not yet been announced.

When we can rush a project for a leap in wealth, we shall mostly decline.

This is to say, I endeavor to keep Ramate small.

When an platform needs outside investment to grow, we shall most often spin out.

When our resources are tapped, we shall take it as a sign our role in the project should be reassessed.

Whenever, Ramate should remain a body small and tightly-coupled enough that one knows personally all of the personalities in the organization.

For all that I have said, little is certain. This shall be an adventure--an adventure of branches.
