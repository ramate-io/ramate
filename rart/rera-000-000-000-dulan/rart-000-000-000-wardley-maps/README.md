## Summary
[Wardley Maps](https://github.com/HiredThought/wardley-maps-ebook/raw/main/bin/Wardley%20Maps%20-%20Simon%20Wardley.pdf) describes an approach to organizational intelligence which seeks to render a "topographical" interpretation of a value chain. We appreciate this geometrization of abstract business categories and the discussion points it provides.

## Description
[Wardley Maps](https://github.com/HiredThought/wardley-maps-ebook/raw/main/bin/Wardley%20Maps%20-%20Simon%20Wardley.pdf) place a relational graph of a value chain over a two dimensional space wherein the visibility of a component to a user is placed on the Y-axis and the evolution of the component is placed on the X-axis. As is emphasized in Simon Wardley's work, most of the value in a Wardley Map lies in the process of its creation, i.e., the associated communication. While there are empirical bases for the technique, it is not intended as a descriptive or prescriptive model of organizational intelligence.

## Justification
This approach to describing organizational intelligence--both in its form and in the process described by Simon Wardley in [Wardley Maps](https://github.com/HiredThought/wardley-maps-ebook/raw/main/bin/Wardley%20Maps%20-%20Simon%20Wardley.pdf)--helps apply special reasoning into the context of business intelligence. We believe this can be a useful tool for strategy, tactics, and planning.
