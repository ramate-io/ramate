### T1: Complete OROAD-0
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **T1** is where we put some meat on the bone by pursuing **[OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md)**

- **Starts:** T1 + 0 months
- **Depends on:** $\emptyset$
- **Ends:** T1 + 9 Months
- **Contents:**
  - **[T1.1](#t11-complete-oroad-0):** Complete OROAD-0
  - **[T1.2](#t12-ensure-ramate-llc-is-legally-prepared-to-employ-or-contract-contributors)**: Ensure Ramate LLC is legally prepared to employ or contract contributors

  - **[T1.4](#t14-experiment-with-some-less-intensive-ventures):** Experiment with some less intensive ventures

**T1** seeks the completion of [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md). [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md) contains provisions for technology, staff, and funding.

As noted in [RPRE-0](/rpre/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rpre-000-000-000/README.md), we are making a bet on [OAC](https://www.github.com/ramate-io/oac). **T1** is the roadmap which initially guides this bet.

This period will be primarily characterized by [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) working alone but slowly generating interest in Ramate's projects amongst peers as well as trying out collaborations.

#### T1.1: Complete OROAD-0
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Complete [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md).

#### T1.2: Ensure Ramate LLC is legally prepared to employ or contract contributors
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Take steps to ensure that Ramate LLC is legally prepared to employ or contract contributors in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan.

> [!NOTE]
> **[[Liam Monninger]](mailto:liam@ramate.io)**
>
> I would love to have the ability to employ or contract contributors outside of these jurisdictions. But, these will be the priorities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **[[Liam Monninger]](mailto:liam@ramate.io)**
>
> This could be viewed as a dependency for some objectives in [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md).

#### T1.3: Identify IP strategy and prepare licensing
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

During [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md), we will be teasing out many revenue models: application developer, infrastructure provider, implementation services, open-source foundation, etc. To ensure we are in a good position to accelerate on the application developer model in particular, we will want to have a coherent legal and operational strategy about how to develop applications in a manner which preserves their IP but also the open goals of OAC, Ramate, and Robles.

To this point, the primary instinct has been to suggest a spinout for all IP we would like to protect for the purpose of revenue and likewise those ventures which are characterized by revenue-driving business operations. That is, each application or application suite would have a spinout. However, it ought to be well understood how such a spinout would come about and direct revenue back to Ramate s.t. such a strategy could be quickly rolled-out in **[T2](#t2-meditation)**.

#### T1.4: Experiment with some less intensive ventures
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Ramate does not intend to have a restrictive sense of self. Further, it is currently and simply [Liam Monninger's](mailto:liam@ramate.io) single-member LLC. We should lean into this perspective and position early on by trying some less intensive ventures.

These could include:
- [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) is building the [`roadline` API](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/tree/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-005#t6-roadline-api) for his internal planning. Maybe there's a way to push out a freemium application for this or some other API.
- We are currently putting quite a bit of effort into our repository organization and docs. If other organizations like the way these are set up, it could be an easy contract here or there to do it for them.
- [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) has some contacts at a Taiwanese shoe company that has yet to hop to the US market. We could try a pop-up shop with relatively low overhead.
- [Liam Monninger's](mailto:liam@ramate.io) brother is in wine. We could invest in his winemaking and see if we can turn a profit on a new bottle.
- [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) has a few special recipes he's been waiting to try as a pop-up food stand. May be worth a shot.
- [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) knows a few artists and people who are interested in creating spaces for creatives. We could invest as partners in the spaces. We could segue artist output into merchandise.
- [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) has several connections who are also launching technology startups which are further along. There could be small investments which we could make to generate some revenue from these.

These sorts of less intensive ventures could form a revenue backbone for Ramate LLC which allows for more ambitious projects to continue with longer timelines.

### T2: Meditation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **T2** is where we take a brief pause to think about what may come next.

- **Starts:** T1 + 9 months
- **Depends on:** [T1](#t1-complete-oroad-0)
- **Ends:** T2 + 3 Months
- **Contents:**
  - **[T2.1](#t21-cut-back-operations):** Cut back operations
  - **[T2.2](#t22-liam-monninger-to-focus-on-personal-finances):** Liam Monninger to focus on personal finances
  - **[T2.3](#t23-check-in-with-prospective-collaborators):** Check-in with prospective collaborators
  - **[T2.4](#t24-go-low-cost):** Go low cost
  - **[T2.5](#t25-dogfood):** Dogfood
  - **[T2.6](#t26-check-out-the-competition):** Check out the competition
  - **[T2.7](#t27-gather-wisdom-from-mentors):** Gather wisdom from mentors

After the success of **[T1](#t1-complete-oroad-0)**, we should have a lot of information about how the Ramate will be able to proceed practically.

We should know how much funding we have. We should know if there is initial interest in the technology we are building. We should have a sense of how difficult continuing to pursue the planned project and revenue models shall be.

**T2** is a brief period to reduce costs and operations, and proceed to meditate on the future of the organization.

#### T2.1: Cut back operations
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We will figure out how to cut operations to essentially just maintain and moderately live services. We should not be attempting to develop anything new.

#### T2.2: [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) to focus on personal finances
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

[Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) will take some time to sort his personal finances, determining how much he has to personal invest into Ramate LLC.

#### T2.3: Check-in with prospective collaborators
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

At this point, we would have hopefully engaged with some prospective collaborators under [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md). We would also have in mind the shortlist from [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core). We would use this time to take a temperature check on the current projects, understand projects collaborators might like to pursue, and ultimately suggest shared next steps.

This may involve things traveling to these prospective collaborators, reviewing their projects, and generating additional informational materials.

#### T2.4: Go low cost
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We would likely want to cut back on as many costs as we can during this period. This would keep the burn through existing funding low and potentially bridge a gap between available and future funding.

This will likely involve [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) attempting to reduce his personal living expenses, which may partially suit as part of [T2.2](#t22-liam-monninger-to-focus-on-personal-finances) will likely be [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) considering where to buy a home.

#### T2.5: Dogfood
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Use the services we have developed to help identify weak and strongpoints.

#### T2.6: Check out the competition
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Identify would-be competitors amongst our current services. Use these competitors services.

#### T2.7: Gather wisdom from mentors
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Check-in with mentors. This will likely involve a bit of travel to these mentors and presenting our projects.

### T3: Try out revenue models
> [!IMPORTANT]
> We use **T3** to try and feel out the best way to make some money which would sustain the organization.

- **Starts:** T2 + 3 months
- **Depends on:** [T2](#t2-meditation)
- **Ends:** T3 + 1 year
- **Contents:**
  - **[T3.1](#t31-generate-revenue-from-a-consumer-application):** Generate revenue from a consumer application
  - **[T3.2](#t32-generate-revenue-from-infrastructure-platform):** Generate revenue from infrastructure platform
  - **[T3.3](#t33-generate-revenue-from-implementation-services):** Generate revenue from implementation services
  - **[T3.4](#t34-launch-spinouts-through-collaborators-maintain-open-source):** Launch spinouts through collaborators, maintain open source
  - **[T3.5](#t35-consider-outside-investment-and-investor-signals):** Consider outside investment and investor signals
  - **[T3.6](#t36-short-sighted-services):** Short-sighted services

Under [T1](#t1-complete-oroad-0) we should have began to fill out a few different revenue models: applications, infrastructure, implementation services, open-source foundation, etc. **T3** would seek to temporarily shift the focus away from developing technology and instead to investing resources into pursuing these revenue models.

The intent of this phase is naturally to figure out how Ramate can properly sustain itself.

All of this should proceed with or without milestones in [T4: Grow the organization](#t4-grow-the-organization). If necessary, [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) continuing to go it mostly alone or a more independent set of collaborations should be within expectations.

During this period and in future periods, we would still like to maintain the open mindset to smaller less intensive ventures indicated by [T1.4](#t14-experiment-with-some-less-intensive-ventures).

#### T3.1: Generate revenue from a consumer application
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We should target generating 25% of total costs in revenue from a consumer application over [T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models). This should be a pronounced enough effort that we have a sense of the viability of such an application and understanding of what pushing towards profitability should look like.

At the time of writing, the current leading idea for this application is **Thro** which is described in [RPRE-0](/rpre/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rpre-000-000-000/README.md).

#### T3.2: Generate revenue from infrastructure platform
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We should target making three deals with high-quality partners to use an infrastructure platform we provide around [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac) and [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles). We assert we can be lax about revenue requirements. If we identify those partners so early on, that would be a strong signal of viability of the platform and subsequent deals would be large.

#### T3.3: Generate revenue from implementation services
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Similar to [T3.2](#t32-generate-revenue-from-infrastructure-platform), we should target making implementation service agreements related to [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac) and [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) with three high-quality partners.

> [!NOTE]
> **[[Liam Monninger]](mailto:liam@ramate.io)**
>
> A bit to my chagrin, I think this most likely means returning to some old friends in crypto, providing a free demo implementation, and then negotiating follow-on services. One of my original proposals included extending free implementation services to my former employer, [Movement Labs](https://movementlabs.xyz/), for example.

#### T3.4: Launch spinouts through collaborators, maintain open source
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

In an ideal world, our initial collaborations under [OROAD-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md) would have led to a few friends and colleagues--or even [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) himself--having an idea that might suit outside funding and be able to channel some of that funding back to Ramate as payment for maintaining relevant open source.

This would demonstrate viability of Ramate as open source foundation, e.g., the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

> [!TIP]
> **[[Liam Monninger]](mailto:liam@ramate.io)**
>
> This my favorite model as it most cleanly separates concerns and I believe sets up best for what Ramate should be in the long run.

#### T3.5: Consider outside investment and investor signals
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Although we would like to avoid it, we would be wise to use **T3** to consider taking investment which would allow us to pursue more distant revenue models. These could rely on services that would take longer to build. We conversely want to rely on investor signals to identify the appropriate pursuits.

We would very much want to skew towards identifying closely-aligned investors and taking small amounts.

#### T3.6: Short-sighted services
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

As an exercise in agility and dogfooding which could bear fruit, we suggest engaging in monthly attempts to stand-up a useful service, often API, for which we can charge a usage fee.

Ideally, this would have something to do with existing software, specifically [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac) and [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles), so as to inform the value of those projects.

### T4: Grow the organization
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **T4** is where we start to add staff and structure.

- **Starts:** T2 + 3 months
- **Depends on:** [T2](#t2-meditation)
- **Ends:** T4 + 2 years
- **Contents:**
  - **[T4.1](#t41-get-a-core):** Get a core
  - **[T4.2](#t42-liam-monninger-to-operate-out-of-the-us-and-europe):** Liam Monninger to operate out of the US and Europe
  - **[T4.3](#t43-slowly-form-small-list-of-close-partnerships):** Slowly form small list of close partnerships

In order to facilitate [T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models) and eventually segue into [T6](#t6-get-good-at-something), [T7](#t7-find-a-groove), and beyond, we will need to grow the organization. **T4** is thus the period when Ramate starts to transition to an organization where people work together consistently, as opposed to a loose and exploratory set of collaborations.

#### T4.1: Get a core
- **[Leads]:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We start growing staff by employing a core cast of collaborators.

All-in-all, Ramate should feel like a burgeoning guild or workshop of closely knit creatives. Our Projects Leads tinker, our Operators ensure the workshop is a functional space, our Marketers make it an inviting place, and our Commercialists make sure the lights stay on.

We thus suggest the following shape for the organization:

- **Affiliates x 3:** collaborators with strong research and engineering backgrounds, who may have ambitions to lead their own projects through Ramate. These Affiliates should be comfortable working through operations, marketing, and business considerations; they should want to own output end-to-end, but be able to benefit from the additional perspective and capacity dedicated collaborators in those domains provide. [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) would primarily function as a Affiliate.
- **Operators x 1:** collaborators who closely understand the products and services--ideally being able to contribute to some extent--but who will primarily deal in planning, human resources, finances, and other operational tasks. We are roughly looking for an engineer who wants to deal with a bit of paperwork, write a bit less code, and not get too heady.
- **Marketers x 1:** creatives who grasp the ethos of Ramate and can individually translate this into brand and outreach. We are roughly looking for somebody happy taking time to generate non-technical content that excites.
- **Commercialists x 1:** collaborators concerned with presenting business models, conducting market research, selling, working with lawyers, and generally channeling creative output into pursuits that can sustain Ramate. We are roughly looking for somebody who will slowly and carefully find highly-aligned business opportunities and structures.

We anticipate collaborators would rotate through Ramate--attempting their own ventures and coming back. However, during this period we would want to keep the core mostly intact particularly the **Affiliates** and the **Operator**, so that we can establish a culture of work to which the later more fluid dynamics can be anchored.

Throughout the various eras at Ramate, we expect collaborators will be highly familiar--people we know personally or with whom we have worked with closely in the past.

#### T4.2: Liam Monninger to operate out of the US and Europe
- **[Leads]:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

At this point, we would not likely have long-term physical office spaces. [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) would, however, start conducting operations out of the US and Europe. This would include meeting with clients and partners, hosting colocations, attending conferences and public events, and just generally working.

#### T4.3: Slowly form small list of close partnerships
- **[Leads]:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We anticipate Ramate's most predictable success--in terms of adoption and revenue--will typically come in the form of business-to-business interactions. For this reason, we believe part of growing the organization will be identifying a set of first-order partnerships.

### T5: Structure small grants
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Under **T5**, we issue some small grants to propel the technical pursuits of the organization and begin a talent pipeline.

- **Starts:** T2 + 2 months
- **Depends on:** [T2](#t2-meditation)
- **Ends:** T5 + 6 months
- **Contents:**
  - **[T5.1](#t51-work-on-grant-to-internet-research-initiative-at-ucla):** Work on grant to Internet Research Initiative at UCLA
  - **[T5.2](#t52-stanford-summer-doctoral-intern):** Stanford summer doctoral intern
  - **[T5.3](#t53-grant-to-dr-naiks-lab):** Grant to Dr. Naik's lab

We propose that, following [T2](#t2-meditation), we would like to issue a series of small grants to research institutions which may help further technical pursuits while also establishing a talent pipeline.

#### T5.1: Work on grant to Internet Research Initiative at UCLA
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

[Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) is an alumnus of the [Internet Research Initiative at UCLA](https://www.iri.ucla.edu/). We would like to sponsor an aligned grant project.

#### T5.2: Stanford summer doctoral intern
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

[Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) has spoken to several former colleagues who are currently doctoral students or post-doctoral students at Stanford. They have expressed interest in potentially taking a summer internship or short-term research position with Ramate, depending on its success.

#### T5.3: Grant to Dr. Naik's lab
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

[Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) has worked with UPenn's [Dr. Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/) before. Dr. Naik's lab has been focused on formal verification for many years and has made inroads into the intersection of the discipline with artificial intelligence and swarm coordination. We would like to issue a grant in pursuit of these inroads.

### T6: Get good at something
> [!IMPORTANT]
> We use **T6** to hone in on a revenue model from **[T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models)**.

- **Starts:** T3 + 1 year
- **Depends on:** [T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models)
- **Ends:** T6 + 1 year
- **Contents:**
  - **[T6.1](#t61-analyze-and-optimize-best-revenue-model-from-t3):** Analyze and optimize best revenue model from T3
  - **[T6.2](#t62-improve-relevant-technology):** Improve relevant technology
  - **[T6.3](#t63-refine-operations):** Refine operations
  - **[T6.3](#t63-review-and-refine-brand):** Review and refine brand
  - **[T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop):** Expand the workshop

Under **T6**, we would pick the "best" revenue model from **[T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models)** and place most of our efforts on it.

#### T6.1: Analyze and optimize best revenue model from **[T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models)**
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Review the model from **[T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models)**. Decide upon improvements. Rinse and repeat.

We believe we should target covering 50% of total costs with this model. We are prepared to run Ramate at a loss of another year, but also expect smaller ventures in the vein of [T1.4](#t14-experiment-with-some-less-intensive-ventures) should bear some fruit.

#### T6.2: Improve relevant technology
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Plan development goals around improving relevant technology for the best revenue model identified under **[T3](#t3-try-out-revenue-models)**.

#### T6.3: Refine operations
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Our workshop should be expanding under [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core). Regardless, we should be taking this time to refine our operations, producing better and better output for our clients

#### T6.3: Review and refine brand
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Our marketing should be expanding under [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core). Regardless, we should take time to review and refine our branding

#### T6.4: Expand the workshop
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

As we start to get good at our business, we would like to bring some more collaborators into the workshop. We don't expect massive expanding operations, marketing, or business development--in some sense we hope we don't do much of that in the long run either.

We thus suggest the following shape:

- **Affiliates x 4:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Operators x 1:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Marketers x 1:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Commercialists x 1:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Designers x 1:** creatives who will focus on design of products and merchandise. This will be someone to reduce the creative load on the Marketer and hopefully add idiosyncrasy and quality to our aesthetics.
- **Engineers x 3:** collaborators who have a strong research and engineering background, but don't necessarily want to be conceptual helmsman or pursue their own projects to the same extent as the **Affiliates**. These are people comfortable with being extra hands in the workshop.
- **Analysts x 1:** collaborators who have strong ability working with data and are interested in performing meta-analyses of Ramate.

At this point, we would expect collaborators to be rotating through Ramate. In particular, we would hope **Affiliates** are spinning out projects and, thus, that there is, in the least, some resource share with these projects.

We expect those who fill into the **Engineer**, **Designer**, and **Analyst** roles may be less committed to projects which are specific to Ramate.

### T7: Find a groove
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **T7** further expands the core operations following the success of [T6](#t6-get-good-at-something)

- **Starts:** T6 + 1 year
- **Depends on:** [T4](#t4-grow-the-organization), [T5](#t5-structure-small-grants), [T6](#t6-get-good-at-something)
- **Ends:** T7 + 2 years
- **Contents:**
  - **[T7.1](#t71-expand-the-workshop):** Expand the workshop
  - **[T7.2](#t72-continue-to-refine-core-business):** Continue to refine core business
  - **[T7.3](#t73-recover-diversity):** Recover diversity

Now that we have a business that is functioning, we start to grow it slightly and regain some of the technical diversity with which we began.

The diversity of our pursuits beyond the core technological thrust should be progressed concurrently. However, this is left **[T8](#t8-create-the-lifestyle)**.

#### T7.1: Expand the workshop
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

To facilitate growing business and technical diversity, we add to the team.

We suggest the following shape for core operations:

- **Affiliates x 5:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Operators x 2:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Marketers x 1:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Commercialists x 1:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Designers x 1:** see [T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop).
- **Engineers x 5:** see [T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop).
- **Analysts x 1:** see [T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop).

We have now reached close to the final form. **Affiliates**, as always perform end-to-end roles guiding their projects. We expand the **Operators** to account for the expectation of shared planning with spinouts and partners. We also add a couple more **Engineers** to scale development.

The other roles remain the same. While an argument could be made for placing these roles in dialogue with specialist colleagues by adding additional headcount, we again want to run things through the **Affiliates**. They should be sounding boards for the **Marketer**, the **Designer**, the **Commercialist**, and the **Analyst**.

#### T7.2: Continue to refine core business
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Continue to refine the core business, following the steps from [T6: Get good at something](#t6-get-good-at-something).

#### T7.3: Recover diversity
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

Begin to reintroduce attempts at revenue models from [T3: Try out revenue models](#t3-try-out-revenue-models). We may find these more effective with our positioning and operational expertise.

Additionally, we should now be able to invest in a more diverse **Affiliate** projects.

> [!NOTE]
> **[T8](#t8-create-the-lifestyle)** provides for some additional exploratory positions for more diverse ventures.

### T8: Create the lifestyle
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **T8** diversifies Ramate's pursuits and externalities, following the success [T6](#t6-get-good-at-something).

- **Starts:** T6 + 1 year
- **Depends on:** [T4](#t4-grow-the-organization), [T5](#t5-structure-small-grants), [T6](#t6-get-good-at-something)
- **Ends:** T8 + 2 years
- **Contents:**
  - **[T8.1](#t81-get-our-workspaces):** Get our workspaces
  - **[T8.2](#t82-fold-in-smaller-efforts):** Fold in smaller efforts
  - **[T8.3](#t83-add-some-character-to-the-workshop):** Add some character to the workshop

#### T8.1: Get our workspaces
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

At this point, we would like to have some workspaces for Ramate. However, we'd like for these to be in quieter locales, have shared use, and be accompanied with living quarters.

We'd like to aim for one workspace in the United States, one in Europe, and one in Asia.

We currently like the following US locations:
- Chico, CA
- Carmel, CA
- Portola Valley, CA
- San Clemente, CA
- Waimea, Kona, HI
- Poipu, Kauai, HI

We currently like the following European locations:
- Ortisei, South Tirol, Italy
- Marazion/Penzance, Cornwall, UK
- St. Ives, Cornwall, UK
- Ereceira, Portugal
- Bilbao, Spain
- Lyon, France
- Sankt Anton am Arlberg, Austria

We currently like the following Asian locations:
- Kamakura, Japan
- Ohara, Japan
- Da'an, Taipei, Taiwan
- Dulan, Taiwan

We would like to operate each with a workspace for Ramate, a joined service such as a restaurant, and perhaps local shop.

We would also like to have nearby living quarters so as to facilitate colocations, periods working from the location individually, and general Ramate perks.

#### T8.2: Fold in smaller efforts
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We move to bring the smaller and more tangential efforts, such as those suggested by [T1.4](#t14-experiment-with-some-less-intensive-ventures), into Ramate operations properly.

#### T8.3: Add some character to the workshop
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

To facilitate [T8.1](#t81-get-our-workspaces) and [T8.2](#t82-fold-in-smaller-efforts), we add to the team as follows:

- **Venturists x 2:** a collaborator performing a non-technical equivalent to **Affiliates** for the peripheral ventures in which Ramate engages.
- **Superintendents x 1:** a collaborator who oversees operations for the workspaces, joined services, and pursuits of the **Venturists**.

### T9: Fulfill the charter
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **T9** is the endgame. Having achieved stability in its intended character, Ramate pursues its charter.

- **Starts:** T8 + 2 years
- **Depends on:** [T7](#t7-find-a-groove), [T8](#t8-create-the-lifestyle)
- **Ends:** $\emptyset$
- **Contents:**
  - **[T9.1](#t91-final-intended-expansion-of-the-workshop):** Final intended expansion of the workshop
  - **[T9.2](#t92-pursue-topics-in-ai-safety-swarm-coordination-and-robotics):** Pursue topics in AI safety, swarm coordination, and robotics
  - **[T9.3](#t93-fulfill-the-charter):** Fulfill the charter

#### T9.1: Final intended expansion of the workshop
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

We make what we intend as the final expansion of the workshop to reach Ramate's steadystate. It takes the following form:

- **Affiliates x 7:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Operators x 2:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Marketers x 2:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Commercialists x 1:** see [T4.1](#t41-get-a-core).
- **Designers x 2:** see [T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop).
- **Engineers x 5:** see [T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop).
- **Analysts x 1:** see [T6.4](#t64-expand-the-workshop).
- **Venturists x 3:** see [T8.3](#t83-add-some-character-to-the-workshop).
- **Superintendents x 1:** see [T8.3](#t83-add-some-character-to-the-workshop).

We expand the **Affiliates** to continue to capture core technical value generation. We add an additional **Marketer** to support the expansion of **Affiliate** and **Venturist** projects. We add an additional designer primarily to ensure **Venturist** projects have available design resources. Finally, we add an additional **Venturist** to propel peripheral projects.

At this point, the rotation effect should be in full effect. However, we expect that the value and sticking power of the Ramate organization is apparent to its participants, and thus that it is a fairly predictable springboard.

#### T9.2: Pursue topics in AI safety, swarm coordination, and robotics
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

[OAC](https://www.github.com/ramate-io/oac) begins with a lofty ambition of pursuing solutions to AI safety problems for a future of safe swarm coordination and robotics. If this pursuit has not properly kicked-off, we would like to ensure it does once Ramate has stabilized.

#### T9.3: Fulfill the charter
- **Leads:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

[RPROC-0](/rproc/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rproc-000-000-000/README.md) describes a philosophical character for Ramate which is humanistically branching. This means leaning into our diverse pursuits and living out the dream of the wonderful workshop we hope to have built.

While we anticipate the core problems with which [OAC](https://www.github.com/ramate-io/oac) contends will always be a sort of practical anchor, the ideal to which we appeal is the sense of the workshop itself.
