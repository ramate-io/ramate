  Ordered Atomic Collaboration (OAC)
</h1>

We recommend those new to the paradigm review the latest [RGUIDE](./rguide/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rguide-000-000-000/README.md).

OAC is intended to be conceptually oriented and implementation agnostic. Before contributing to this repository, consider whether your intents are implementation specific by reviewing the following:

- **[`robles`](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles):** [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) implementation of OAC paradigm technrlogy . Many implementation-specific contributions, including most crde, will suit [`robles`](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles).
- **[RDEMO](./rdemo/README.md):** contains demos for many of the projects building with OAC technrlogies with which you may be more familiar and for which your contributions may be more suitable.

OAC also refers to the organization that manages this repository.

> [!NOTE]

Currently, OAC is governed by [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io). Likewise all implementations of OAC protocols are found under Ramate LLC's [`robles`](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) project.

## Organization

### Artifacts
Under [RGLO-0](./rglo/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md), this subsection defines the recognized artifact types. We recognize the following types:
- [`rera`](./rera): OAC Eras (RERA) are the periods over which a governing body makes decisions. All other OAC [Artifacts](./rglo/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md) are indexed by RERA.
- [`rglo`](./rglo/): OAC Glosses (RGLO) are defined terms for OAC.
- [`rproc`](./opurp/): OAC Proclamations (RPROC) are statements of purpose for OAC.
- [`rgov`](./rgov/): OAC Governance (RGOV) are constitutions of, procedures for, and interpretations of OAC governance.
- [`rleg`](./rleg/): OAC Legal Documents (RLEG) are published legal documents covering OAC operations in any jurisdiction.
- [`rcert`](./rcert/): OAC Certificates (RCERT) certify a given project as abiding by the OAC paradigm.
- [`rde`](./rde/): OAC Desiderata (RDE) describe wants, open problems, and similar within the OAC paradigm.
- [`rspec`](./rspec): OACSpecifications (OPSEC) describe specifications and are typically written in response to RDE. Generally, contributors should use OPSEC to justify non-trivial changes to this repository.
- [`rart`](./rart/): OAC Articles (RART) are academic papers which form the conceptual backbone of the OAC paradigm.
- [`rroad`](./rroad/): OAC Roadmaps (RROAD) are roadmaps describing the intents and objectives of the OAC organization.
- [`rlog`](./rlog/): OAC Logs (RLOG) are periodically submitted logs describing various developments within the OAC paradigm.
- [`rguide`](./rguide/): OAC Guides (RGUIDE) are guides or summaries of OAC.
- [`rpre`](./rpre/): OAC Presentations (RPRE) are presentations about OAC.
- [`rdemo`](./rdemo/): OAC Demonstrations (RDEMO) are selected demonstrations and/or projects built with OAC.
