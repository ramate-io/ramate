## Summary
We adopt the standard proposed in **[OGOV-0](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac/blob/main/ogov/oera-000-000-000-dulan/ogov-000-000-000/README.md)**.

We establish that the objects of governance are all the properties of [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io), the agreements to which [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) is party, and the bylaws to which [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) adheres. These include [Artifacts](../../../rglo/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md) in this repository and all contents of the [`ramate-io`](https://github.com/ramate-io) GitHub organization. [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) controls these objects of governance solely in cases wherein other parties are not involved or in which it must otherwise abide by agreed terms.

As [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io) is the sole member of Ramate LLC there are no non-trivial bylaws during [RERA-0: Dulan](/rera/rera-000-000-000-dulan/README.md). All decisions are de facto his. However, we provide several standards to which he and Ramate LLC shall commit.

Finally, we delegate Ramate'd decision making w.r.t. its implementation of [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac) protocols to the [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) project under [ROGOV](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles/tree/main/rogov).

## Continuity
As the first RGOV, this document does not establish continuity with any previous regime.

## Measures
- **Contents**
    - **[M1](#m1-the-objects-of-governance-are-the-ramate-llcs-properties-agreements-and-bylaws):** The objects of governance are the [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io)'s properties, agreements, and bylaws.
    - **[M2](#m2-ramate-llc-is-the-governing-body):** [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) is the governing body.
    - **[M3](#m3-ramate-llc-shall-publish-the-agreements-to-which-it-is-party-as-rleg-to-the-maximum-extent-allowed-by-said-agreements):** [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL publish the agreements to which it is party as [RLEG](/rleg/) to the maximum extent allowed by said agreements.
    - **[M4](#m4-ramate-llc-shall-make-a-best-effort-to-publish-its-finances-to-the-maximum-extent-allowed-as-rleg):** [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL make a best effort to publish its finances to the maximum extent allowed as [RLEG](/rleg/)
    - **[M5](#m5-robles-shall-govern-decisions-concerning-the-implementation-of-oac):** [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) SHALL govern decisions concerning the implementation of [OAC](https://www.ramate.io).

### M1: The objects of governance are the [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io)'s properties, agreements, and bylaws.
We establish that the objects of governance are all the properties of [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io), the agreements to which [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) is party, and the bylaws to which [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) adheres. These include [Artifacts](../../../rglo/rera-000-000-000-dulan/rglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md) in this repository and all contents of the [`ramate-io`](https://github.com/ramate-io) GitHub organization. [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) controls these objects of governance solely in cases wherein other parties are not involved or in which it must otherwise abide by agreed terms.

Thus, Ramate LLC SHALL henceforth make a best to effort to take all decisions which concern the objects of governance via the procedures defined in this repository.

### M2: [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) is the governing body.
[Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL retain the right to make decisions pursuant to [M1](#m1-artifacts-are-the-objects-of-governance) as it sees fit. As currently, [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) is a single-member LLC without any bylaws, no further specification is needed. All decisions are left to [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io).

### M3: [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL publish the agreements to which it is party as [RLEG](/rleg/) to the maximum extent allowed by said agreements.
In the event that [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) enters into any agreement with any party in any jurisdiction, including with the State itself, [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL  publish said agreement as an [RLEG](/rleg/) in this repository unless said agreement would otherwise prohibit.

> [!NOTE]
> **[[Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)]**
>
> I will make an initial statement that [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) does not have any obligations apart from those that continue its good-standing with the State of California.

### M4: [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL make a best effort to publish its finances to the maximum extent allowed as [RLEG](/rleg/)
[Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL make a best effort to provide clear accounts of its sources of income and expenditure in this repository. For the time being, the format of these publications shall not be further specified other than that they should be summarized in [RLEG](/rleg/).

> [!NOTE]
> **[[Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)]**
>
> I would like to figure out the best format to do this progressively. I am not going to overindex now, as the income will simply be quarterly allowance I deposit to the LLC's checking and the expenditures will be primarily paying myself back from this allowance.

### M5: [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) SHALL govern decisions concerning the implementation of [OAC](https://www.ramate.io).
The implementation of [OAC](https://github.com/ramate-io/oac) protocols SHALL be governed by [Robles](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles).

This does not include [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) decision making concerning its continued support of the project nor decision making within OAC under [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) governance. Instead, this simply refers to the governance of implementation decision-making.

## Interpretations
We assert there is no precedence for interpretation owing to the lack of [continuity](#continuity).

## Agreeing
- **[AGR-1: Liam Monninger](./agreeing/agr-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the delegation to [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) suits this early developmental phase ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).

## Dissenting
- **[DIS-1: Liam Monninger](./dissenting/dis-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the stipulations on [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) internal governance are too light ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).
